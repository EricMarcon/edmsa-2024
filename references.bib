  abstract = {Recently there has been growing interest in the use of maximum relative entropy (MaxREnt) as a tool for statistical inference in ecology. In contrast, here we propose MaxREnt as a tool for applying statistical mechanics to ecology. We use MaxREnt to explain and predict species abundance patterns in ecological communities in terms of the most probable behaviour under given environmental constraints, in the same way that statistical mechanics explains and predicts the behaviour of thermodynamic systems. We show that MaxREnt unifies a number of different ecological patterns: (i) at relatively local scales a unimodal biodiversity-productivity relationship is predicted in good agreement with published data on grassland communities, (ii) the predicted relative frequency of rare vs. abundant species is very similar to the empirical lognormal distribution, (iii) both neutral and non-neutral species abundance patterns are explained, (iv) on larger scales a monotonic biodiversity-productivity relationship is predicted in agreement with the species-energy law, (v) energetic equivalence and power law self-thinning behaviour are predicted in resource-rich communities. We identify mathematical similarities between these ecological patterns and the behaviour of thermodynamic systems, and conclude that the explanation of ecological patterns is not unique to ecology but rather reflects the generic statistical behaviour of complex systems with many degrees of freedom under very general types of environmental constraints.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the prevalence of Silicon Valley-style localizations of individual manufacturing industries in the United States. A model in which localized industry-specific spillovers, natural advantages, and pure random chance all contribute to geographic concentration is used to develop a test for whether observed levels of concentration are greater than would be expected to arise randomly and to motivate new indices of geographic concentration and of coagglomeration. The proposed indices control for differences in the size distribution of plants and for differences in the size of the geographic areas for which data are available. As a consequence, comparisons of the degree of geographic concentration across industries can be made with more confidence. Our empirical results provide a strong reaffirmation of the previous wisdom in that we find almost all industries to be somewhat localized. In many industries, however, the degree of localization is slight. We explore the nature of agglomerative forces in describing patterns of concentration, the geographic scope of localization, and the coagglomeration of related industries and of industries with strong upstream-downstream ties.},

The evolution of localization in Europe proved much more complicated empirically than the predictions based on Krugman's hypothesis. Using Eurostat regional data for the period 1985-2001, the paper shows that while manufacturing employment trickled down among regions, after the completion of the European Single Market a slight agglomeration occurred, but only across national boundaries. National specialization has emerged particularly in the European Union founding Member States. Moreover, there is evidence of an increasing polarization of the North-South divide closely connected with the growing concentration of high-technology sectors.},

Manufacturing, however, has become significantly more concentrated relative to the distribution of aggregate employment (increased “relative concentration”), while becoming significantly less concentrated relative to physical space (decreased “topographic concentration”). The contribution of manufacturing to the topographic concentration of aggregate employment has fallen from 26{\%} to 13{\%} over our sample period.},

  abstract = {Measuring functional or phylogenetic diversity is the object of an active literature. The main issues to address are relating measures to a clear conceptual framework, allowing unavoidable estimation-bias correction and decomposing diversity along spatial scales. We provide a general mathematical framework to decompose measures of species-neutral, phylogenetic or functional diversity into $\alpha$ and $\beta$ components. We first unify the definitions of phylogenetic and functional entropy and diversity as a generalization of HCDT entropy and Hill numbers when an ultrametric tree is considered. We then derive the decomposition of diversity. We propose a bias correction of the estimates allowing meaningful computation from real, often undersampled communities. Entropy can be transformed into true diversity, that is an effective number of species or communities. Estimators of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-entropy, phylogenetic and functional entropy are provided. Proper definition and estimation of diversity is the first step towards better understanding its underlying ecological and evolutionary mechanisms.},

These in turn affect the way species divide the environments among themselves in communities, and, therefore, the numbers of species which can coexist.

The aim of this paper is to review and assess 12 methods of diversity ordering and discuss their relationships in detail. Two of the methods are new to the ecological literature. The diversity ordering methods are compared as to their effectiveness in graphically displaying the differences of community structure and demonstrating the (non-)comparability of communities. Small, medium and large data sets were used to evaluate the methods. A small artificial data set (five to seven species) and a large semi-artificial data set (31 — 141 species) are used in this paper. The results suggest that R{\'{e}}nyi's diversity index family and Logarithmic dominance ordering are the most useful methods for diversity ordering of communities of all sizes. Right-tailsum diversity ordering performs well for small communities.},

  volume   = {14},
  pages    = {51--60},
  abstract = {It is routinely understood that the total diversity within a metacommunity (? -diversity) can be partitioned into one component summarizing the diversity within communities (a-diversity) and a second component representing the contribution of diversity (or differences) between communities ({\ss}-diversity). The underlying thought is that merging differentiated communities should raise the total diversity above the average level of diversity within the communities. The crucial point in this partitioning criterion is set by the notion of “diversity within communities” (DWC) and its relation to the total diversity. The common approach to summarizing DWC is in terms of averages. Yet there are many different ways to average diversity, and not all of these averages stay below the total diversity for every measure of diversity, corrupting the partitioning criterion. This raises the question of whether conceptual properties of diversity measures exist, the fulfillment of which implies that all measures of DWC obey the partitioning criterion. It is shown that the straightforward generalization of the plain counting of types (richness) leads to a generic diversity measure that has the desired properties and, together with its effective numbers, fulfills the partitioning criterion for virtually all of the relevant diversity measures in use. It turns out that the classical focus on DWC (a) and its complement ({\ss} as derived from a and ? ) in the partitioning of total diversity captures only the apportionment perspective of the distribution of trait diversity over communities (which implies monomorphism within communities at the extreme). The other perspective, differentiation, cannot be assessed appropriately unless an additional level of diversity is introduced that accounts for differences between communities (such as the joint “type-community diversity”). Indices of apportionment IA (among which is GST and specially normalized versions of {\ss}) and differentiation ID are inferred, and it is demonstrated that conclusions derived from IA depend considerably on the measure of diversity to which it is applied, and that in most cases an assessment of the distribution of diversity over communities requires additional computation of ID.},

  abstract = {Generally speaking, the term differentiation refers to differences between collections for the distribution of specified traits of their members, while diversity deals with (effective) numbers of trait states (types). Counting numbers of types implies discrete traits such as alleles and genotypes in population genetics or species and taxa in ecology. Comparisons between the concepts of differentiation and diversity therefore primarily refer to discrete traits. Diversity is related to differentiation through the idea that the total diversity of a subdivided collection should be composed of the diversity within the subcollections and a complement called “diversity between subcollections”. The idea goes back to the perception that the mixing of differentiated collections increases diversity. Several existing concepts of “diversity between subcollections” are based on this idea. Among them, -diversity and fixation (inadvertently called differentiation) are the most prominent in ecology and in population genetics, respectively. The pertaining measures are shown to quantify the effect of differentiation in terms of diversity components, though from a dual perspective: the classical perspective of differentiation between collections for their type compositions, and the reverse perspective of differentiation between types for their collection affiliations. A series of measures of diversity-oriented differentiation is presented that consider this dual perspective at two levels of diversity partitioning: the overall type or subcollection diversity and the joint type-subcollection diversity. It turns out that, in contrast with common notions, the measures of fixation (such as FST or GST ) refer to the perspective of type rather than subcollection differentiation. This unexpected observation strongly suggests that the popular interpretations of fixation measures must be reconsidered.},

Information loss is a special case of conditional entropy: namely, it is the entropy of a random variable conditioned on some function of that variable. We show that Shannon entropy gives the only concept of information loss that is functorial, convex-linear and continuous. This characterization naturally generalizes to Tsallis entropy as well.},

  abstract = {Many recent studies have searched to integrate species' functions and phylogenies in the measurement of biodiversity. To obtain easily interpretable measures, some researchers recommended diversity indices expressed in terms of equivalent numbers of species: the number of equally likely and maximally dissimilar species needed to produce the given value of diversity. Then, biodiversity is often calculated at three scales: within communities ($\alpha$ diversity), among communities ($\beta$ diversity) and in a region ($\gamma$ diversity). These three scales are, however, insufficient to tackle the organization of biodiversity in space because, for most organisms, there is a nested hierarchy of multiple scales characterized by different patterns and processes, from the small neighbourhood to the biosphere. We developed methodologies for analysing species, functional, taxonomic or phylogenetic diversity in a hierarchy of multiple scales using equivalent numbers of species. As an example, we analysed the taxonomic and functional diversity of macroinvertebrate assemblages in the Loire River, France, at four levels: within sites ($\alpha$ diversity), among sites within geological regions ($\beta$1 diversity), among geological regions ($\beta$2 diversity) and at the river scale ($\gamma$ diversity). The new hierarchical approaches of biodiversity revealed very low differences among sites within regions and among regions in terms of taxonomy and functional traits (size and diet), despite moderate, significant species turnover among geological regions. We compare our framework with those other authors have developed. We argue that different definitions of $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ diversities are used in the literature reflecting different points of view on biodiversity. We make recommendations on how to normalize functional (or phylogenetic) dissimilarities among species to render sites and regions comparable, and discuss the pros and cons of our approach. The hierarchical approaches of biodiversity in terms of ‘equivalent numbers' respond to current demands to obtain intuitive, easily interpretable components of biodiversity. The approaches we propose go beyond current developments by considering a hierarchy of spatial scales and unbalanced sampling design. They will provide powerful tools to detect the ecological and evolutionary processes that act differently at different scales.},

  abstract = {Estimating Shannon entropy and its exponential from incomplete samples is a central objective of many research fields. However, empirical estimates of Shannon entropy and its exponential depend strongly on sample size and typically exhibit substantial bias. This work uses a novel method to obtain an accurate, low-bias analytic estimator of entropy, based on species frequency counts. Our estimator does not require prior knowledge of the number of species. * We show that there is a close relationship between Shannon entropy and the species accumulation curve, which depicts the cumulative number of observed species as a function of sample size. We reformulate entropy in terms of the expected discovery rates of new species with respect to sample size, i.e., the successive slopes of the species accumulation curve. Our estimator is obtained by applying slope estimators derived from an improved Good-Turing frequency formula. Our method is also applied to estimate mutual information. * Extensive simulations from theoretical models and real surveys show that if sample size is not unreasonably small the resulting entropy estimator is nearly unbiased. Our estimator generally outperforms all previous methods in terms of bias and accuracy (low mean squared error) especially when species richness is large and there is a large fraction of undetected species in samples. * We discuss the extension of our approach to estimate Shannon entropy for multiple incidence data. The use of our estimator in constructing an integrated rarefaction and extrapolation curve of entropy (or mutual information) as a function of sample size or sample coverage (an aspect of sample completeness) is also discussed.

  abstract = {1. Species diversity is most simply measured by counting species. More complicated measures, which take into account the relative abundance of the species, have been derived from information theory or from parameters of statistical distributions fitted to the census data. The information theory formulae can also be used to measure habitat diversity and differences between communities or habitats. In this way, changes in the pattern of species diversity can be compared with changes in the environment. 2. Small or remote islands and islands with uniform topography have fewer species than large or complex islands or islands nearer the source of colonization. For birds and some orders of insects it appears that the rate of colonization of new species is virtually balanced by the rate of extinction, so that the number of species has reached equilibrium. For other organisms, such as mammals, and for all organisms on the most remote islands, this equilibrium has probably not been reached and further increases in the fauna may be expected. The comparison of impoverished island faunas with the mainland faunas whence they were derived shows the effect of relaxed competition. 3. Local variations in the species diversity of small uniform habitats can usually be predicted in terms of the structure and productivity of the habitat. Habitats of similar structure on islands and mainland often have similar species diversities; the impoverishment of the island is reflected in the fact that different habitats on the island have nearly the same species, while different habitats on the mainland have more different species. This is interpreted as evidence that uniform habitats are nearly saturated with species and that new species usually colonize by occupying different habitats from present species. 4. The theory of competition and the facts of character displacement indicate that there is a limiting similarity to species which co-exist within a habitat. Species more similar than this limiting value must occupy different habitats. According to the theory, this limiting value should be less where productivity is high, where family size is low and where the seasons are relatively uniform. It should also be less for pursuing hunters than for species which search for stationary prey. 5. Total species diversities, from areas composed of many types of habitat, are usually, but not always, much greater in the tropics than in temperate regions. This is accomplished by a finer subdivision of habitats (habitat selection) more than by a marked increase in diversity within habitats. This total diversity may still be increasing and may have not reached saturation.},

  abstract = {Entropies such as the Shannon–Wiener and Gini–Simpson indices are not themselves diversities. Conversion of these to effective number of species is the key to a unified and intuitive interpretation of diversity. Effective numbers of species derived from standard diversity indices share a common set of intuitive mathematical properties and behave as one would expect of a diversity, while raw indices do not. Contrary to Keylock, the lack of concavity of effective numbers of species is irrelevant as long as they are used as transformations of concave alpha, beta, and gamma entropies. The practical importance of this transformation is demonstrated by applying it to a popular community similarity measure based on raw diversity indices or entropies. The standard similarity measure based on untransformed indices is shown to give misleading results, but transforming the indices or entropies to effective numbers of species produces a stable, easily interpreted, sensitive general similarity measure. General overlap measures derived from this transformed similarity measure yield the Jaccard index, S{\o}rensen index, Horn index of overlap, and the Morisita–Horn index as special cases.},

  abstract = {Several indices have been created to measure diversity, and the most frequently used are the Shannon-Wiener (H) and Simpson (D) indices along with the number of species (S) and evenness (E). Controversies about which index should be used are common in literature. However, a generalized entropy (Tsallis entropy) has the potential to solve part of these problems. Here we explore a family of diversity indices (S-q; where q is the Tsallis index) and evenness (E-q), based on Tsallis entropy that incorporates the most used indices. It approaches S when q=0, H when q -{\textgreater} 1 and gives D when q=2. In general, varying the value of the Tsallis index (q), S-q varies from emphasis on species richness (q {\textless} 1) to emphasis on dominance (q {\textgreater} 1). Similarly, E-q also works as a tool to investigate diversity. In particular, for a given community, its minimum value represents the maximum deviation from homogeneity (E-q=1) for a particular q (herein named q*). It is remarkable that our analysis indicates that q* and its corresponding evenness, E-q*, are negatively affected by S when using simulated data. They may represent an index related to species rarity. Furthermore, S-q* (i.e. the value of S-q for a specific q*) is positively affected by richness that is an important property of any diversity index. In general, our findings indicate that the indices H, D, S, S-q*, E and E-q* are only part of a whole set of possibilities. In addition, the ecological properties of E-q* and S-q*, proposed here for the first time, show promise in ecology.},

As previously found for tree beta-diversity patterns, this new typology proved to be a non-negligible factor underlying the beta diversity of the communities of medium- to large bodied vertebrates inFrenchGuianan terra firme forests. Although the species studied are almost ubiquitous across the region, they exhibited habitat preferences through significant variation in abundance and in their association index with the different landscape types. As terra firme forests represent more than90{\%}of the Amazon basin, characterizing their heterogeneity – including faunal communities – is a major challenge in neotropical forest ecology.},
